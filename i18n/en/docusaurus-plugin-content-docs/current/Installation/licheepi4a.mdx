## Important!

Before proceeding, compare your board with the image below to ensure they match. Continue only if the boards are identical.

![LicheePi4A Example](/img/image-for-flash/lpi4a.png)

## Demonstration Environment

All installation operations in this tutorial are demonstrated using the following environment:

- **System and Version**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
- **Architecture**: x86_64
- **LicheePi4A Specs**: 16GB RAM + 128GB eMMC

For unofficial environments that might be used, refer to [this page](../issue) for submitting issues.

## Boot Methods Overview

LicheePi4A supports two boot methods: [SD Card Boot](#sd-card-boot) and [eMMC Boot](#booting-from-emmc). Follow the relevant section based on your needs.

## SD Card Boot

**Attention!** No need to change the DIP switch to boot from the SD card! Set the DIP switch as per the eMMC configuration.

![Example of DIP switch](/img/image-for-flash/Switch.png)

The DIP switch is located on the underside of the board. You need to remove the board to access it. The correct configuration is with both switches set to the downward position.

**Note!** Some early versions of the LicheePi4A board do not have a DIP switch.

### Preparation

#### Obtain SD card images

Download the LicheePi4A SD card boot system image with the `sdcard-` prefix from the following links:

- [RevyOS20240720 (Kernel version 5.10)](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20240720/)

- [RevyOS20250110 (Kernel version 6.6)](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20250110/)

The 20240720 image uses Kernel 5.10, which is relatively mature and performs more stably in video encoding/decoding and various applications.  

The 20250110 image uses Kernel 6.6, which may have some unknown issues. Known issues include video stuttering and USB power loss. These problems are currently being addressed.  

Please choose the appropriate image based on your needs after reading the above description.  

The following demonstrates the process using the 20250110 image as an example:  

**Note:** The downloaded `.zst` compressed file is approximately 1.4GB. Ensure that you have at least 12GB of free space on your device to avoid running out of space during the download and extraction process.  

![image-size](/img/image-for-flash/sdcard-image-size.png)  

If downloading via a web browser, click the link to start the download. Your browser will automatically handle the file download. Confirm the download and ensure the file is saved locally.  

![web-download](/img/image-for-flash/web-download.png)  

If you prefer to download via the command line, tools like `wget` and `curl` can be used. In this guide, we use `wget` as the download tool.  

In most [demonstration environments](#demonstration-environment), `wget` is pre-installed. If `wget` is not installed, use the following command to install it:  

```bash
sudo apt install wget
```  

![wget-install](/img/image-for-flash/wget-install.png)  

**Note:** The `sudo` command requires a password for execution. Ensure you know the password before proceeding. This will not be repeated in subsequent steps.  

Once installed, use the following command to download the image archive:  

```bash
wget https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20250110/sdcard-lpi4a-20250110_151339.img.zst
```  

![image-download](/img/image-for-flash/wget-download-sd.png)  

After downloading, you will obtain a file named [sdcard-lpi4a-20250110_151339.img.zst](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20250110/sdcard-lpi4a-20250110_151339.img.zst). This is not the final image file but a compressed archive. You need to extract the compressed file `sdcard-lpi4a-20250110_151339.img.zst` to obtain the final image file `sdcard-lpi4a-20250110_151339.img`.  

In the [demonstration environment](#Demonstratio- Environment) mentioned earlier, `.zst` files can be extracted using various tools such as `zstd`, `tar`, or `7z`. This guide demonstrates one method using the `zstd` tool via the command line. First, you need to install the `zstd` package on your system before extracting the file.  

If you are unsure whether `zstd` is already installed on your system, execute the following command to check the version of `zstd`. If a version is displayed, it indicates that `zstd` is installed.  

```bash
zstd --version
```  

![zstd-version](/img/image-for-flash/zstd-version.png)  

If the version is displayed, like the example below, you have `zstd` is already installed.  

```bash
*** zstd command line interface 64-bits v1.4.8, by Yann Collet ***
```  

If no version information is displayed, install `zstd` using the following commands:  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zstd
```  

![zstd-install](/img/image-for-flash/zstd-install.png)  

After installing `zstd`, you can extract the image file. **Note:** The extracted file will be approximately **10.2GB** in size. Ensure you have enough local storage space before proceeding with the extraction!  

```bash
sudo unzstd sdcard-lpi4a-20250110_151339.img.zst
```  

Once the extraction is complete, you will have the file `sdcard-lpi4a-20250110_151339.img`. At this point, the image file has been successfully obtained in the demonstration environment.  

![imgsize](/img/image-for-flash/sdcard-image.png)  

#### Hardware preparation

Prepare a MicroSD card reader and a MicroSD card. Note that there are compatibility issues with MicroSD cards. RevyOS provides a list of [tested MicroSD cards](https://github.com/revyos/revyos/blob/main/Installation/card%20list.md).  

If your MicroSD card is not on the list of known compatible cards and you encounter issues such as failure to write the image or failure to boot after writing, refer to [this page](../issue) to submit an issue. You can also try the [eMMC boot guide](#booting-from-emmc) for writing the image.  

### Image Writing Methods  

If you choose to boot from an SD card, there are two methods to write the image to the MicroSD card:[Using a graphical interface tool](#writing-the-image-with-balenaetcher) like BalenaEtcher, or [Using the `dd` command in the command line](#writing-the-image-with-dd).  

#### Writing the Image with BalenaEtcher  

Download the BalenaEtcher tool from its official website: [https://etcher.balena.io/](https://etcher.balena.io/). Select the appropriate file for your system. For the [demonstration environment](#Demonstratio- Environment), download and extract [Etcher for Linux x64 (64-bit) (zip)](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases/download/v1.19.25/balenaEtcher-linux-x64-1.19.25.zip).  

![BE-version](/img/image-for-flash/BE-version.png)  

Insert the SD card into the card reader and connect it to your computer.  

Run BalenaEtcher to write the image to the SD card.  
In the BalenaEtcher window, click **"Flash from file"** to select the image file.  
{<LocaleImage src="/img/image-for-flash/BE1.png" />}
After selecting the image file, choose the target device in the second field.  
{<LocaleImage src="/img/image-for-flash/BE2.png" />}
Once both options are selected, click **"Flash"** to write the image.  
{<LocaleImage src="/img/image-for-flash/BE3.png" />}
After some time, a message will indicate that the writing process is complete.  
{<LocaleImage src="/img/image-for-flash/BE4.png" />}

#### Writing the Image with `dd`  

`dd` is a powerful command-line tool in Linux and Unix-like systems, used to copy files or data with specified sizes and formats. It is usually pre-installed.  

Follow these steps to write the image using `dd`:  

First, check the list of devices by running the following command before and after inserting the SD card to identify the corresponding device name of the SD card:

```bash
lsblk
```

The device name for the SD card might be `/dev/sda` or `/dev/mmcblk0`. In the demonstration environment, the SD card partition is identified as `/dev/sda` after executing `lsblk`.

![lsblk](/img/image-for-flash/lsblk.png)

Before writing the image, unmount any mounted partitions of the SD card. If there are multiple partitions, unmount each one:

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sda1
```

If no partitions are mounted, the `umount` command will display `not mounted`, and no further action is needed.

After unmounting the partitions, it is recommended to run the `sudo sync` command to ensure all data is synchronized.

![sync](/img/image-for-flash/sync.png)

After completing the above steps, you can proceed with writing the image. Before writing, ensure that the correct device is set in the `of=` parameter. In the demonstration environment, the SD card is recognized as `sda`. Replace `of=` with your device's partition accordingly.

```bash
sudo dd if=./sdcard-lpi4a-20250110_151339.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress
```

![dd](/img/image-for-flash/dd.png)

After the writing process is complete, run the `sudo sync` command again to ensure data synchronization. Then confirm that the SD card is in an unmounted state before safely removing it and inserting it into the development board.

### Booting the System via SD Card

After writing the image, insert the SD card into the slot shown below.  
![](/img/image-for-flash/lpi4a5.png)

First, connect the HDMI cable (if an external display is needed). Then, use the USB-A to USB-C cable included in the package: connect the USB-C end to the development board and the USB-A end to a USB power source with at least 5V2A output to boot the system.

## Booting from eMMC

When booting the image from eMMC, there are two methods for writing the image: with or without a serial connection. The operations differ slightly, and both methods are introduced below.

**Note!** When booting from eMMC, remove the SD card first!

### Preparation

#### Hardware Preparation



#### Installing the Image Writing Tool

To boot from eMMC, you need to write the `u-boot`, `boot`, and `root` files into the eMMC using the `fastboot` tool. First, confirm whether `fastboot` is installed.

If you are unsure whether `fastboot` is installed, run the following command. This command checks the version of `fastboot`, and the output will indicate whether the `fastboot` package is pre-installed.

```bash
fastboot --version
```

![fastboot-version](/img/image-for-flash/fastboot-version.png)

If the version is displayed correctly, it means `fastboot` is successfully installed. For example, the following output indicates that `fastboot` is installed:

```bash
fastboot version 28.0.2-debian
Installed as /usr/lib/android-sdk/platform-tools/fastboot
```

If no version is displayed, please install `fastboot` in your command line

```bash
sudo apt install fastboot
```

![fastboot-install](/img/image-for-flash/zstd-install.png)

```bash
sudo apt install fastboot 
```

#### Install Serial Console Tool

When using a serial connection, a serial console tool is required for monitoring. There are many serial console tools available, such as `minicom`, `screen`, and `picocom`. In this guide, we will use `minicom` for demonstration.

```bash
sudo apt install minicom
```

After installation, you can confirm if `minicom` was successfully installed by checking its version:

```bash
minicom -version
```

#### Obtain the Image

Download the system image for LicheePi4A from the following links:

- [RevyOS20240720](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20240720/)
- [RevyOS20250110](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20250110/)

**Note!**

The u-boot images for different memory configurations of LicheePi4A are not interchangeable. Please select the appropriate image based on the version of your core board.

| Memory and Storage Combination | Corresponding u-boot Image |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 8G RAM + 8G eMMC               | u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-main_8gemmc.bin |
| 8G RAM + 32G eMMC              | u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-main.bin |
| 16G RAM                        | u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g-main.bin |

If you are unsure about the specifications of your core board, you can scan the QR code on the core board to check. When LicheePi4A is shipped, a QR code sticker is attached to the core board. Scanning it will display the memory and storage configuration of the core board.

For example, for a 16G RAM + 128G eMMC configuration, you can find the QR code sticker here:

![core-card](/img/image-for-flash/core-card.png)

Scanning the QR code will display the following:

![Core board-info](/img/image-for-flash/card-info.png)

After confirming the board specifications, use `wget` to download the u-boot, boot, and root files:

```bash
sudo wget u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g-main.bin
sudo wget boot-lpi4a-20250110_151339.ext4.zst
sudo wget root-lpi4a-20250110_151339.ext4.zst
```

![emmc-download](/img/image-for-flash/wget-download.png)

After downloading, use the `unzstd` command to decompress the root and boot files:

```bash
unzstd boot-lpi4a-20250110_151339.ext4.zst
unzstd root-lpi4a-20250110_151339.ext4.zst
```

Once decompression is complete, you will have the files required for writing the eMMC image.

![file](/img/image-for-flash/unzstd-bootandroot.png)

### Writing the Image to eMMC (Without Serial Connection)

Press and hold the BOOT button on the board, then connect it to your computer. The board will enter flashing mode.

### Writing the Image to eMMC (With Serial Connection)

#### Using `minicom`

First, open `minicom` from the terminal to access the serial console:

```bash
sudo minicom
```

If you need to specify the serial device (e.g., the commonly used USB-to-serial device `ttyUSB0`), you can use:

```bash
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
```

#### Using `screen`
Open `screen` from the terminal. Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with your device, and `115200` with the baud rate:

```bash
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

As shown in the diagram, connect the serial port to the board. The USB end connects to the computer, while the Type-C port on the board connects to the computer using a USB-Type-C cable.

For the serial connection, the red circle (first row, second pin from the left) is GND, the yellow circle (first row, fifth pin) is TX, and the green circle (second row, fifth pin) is RX. The connection to the host should follow TX to RX, RX to TX, and GND to GND.

![](/img/image-for-flash/lpi4a6.png)

After connecting, press any key in the serial console to interrupt the auto-start process. You will see the following u-boot command line (see the last line):

![](/img/image-for-flash/image-start.png)

In the serial console window, enter:

```bash
fastboot usb 0
```

The output will show:
```bash
Light LPI4A 16G# fastboot usb 0
dwc3_gadget_start maximum_speed:5 revision:0x5533330b
dwc3_gadget_start DWC3_DCFG:0x80804
```

This indicates that `fastboot` can be used for flashing. Open another terminal window to proceed with image flashing.

### Flashing the Image
All commands below should be executed in the directory where the image files are located. Pay attention to the file paths and names.

#### Put the Device into U-Boot Fastboot Mode
If the `lsusb` result is not `ID 1234:8888 Brain Actuated Technologies USB download gadget`, run the following commands:
```bash
fastboot flash ram u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g.bin # Replace with the u-boot image for your specific model
fastboot reboot
sleep 1
```

#### Flash the Image
```bash
fastboot flash uboot u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g.bin
fastboot flash boot boot-lpi4a-20240720_171951.ext4
fastboot flash root root-lpi4a-20240720_171951.ext4
```

`fastboot` will display the flashing progress. If a serial connection is established, you can view the detailed progress in the serial console (the example below shows flashing `boot`, with a size of 92,886,476 bytes. You can see the flashed content at `cmd_parameter: boot, imagesize: 92886476`).

![](/img/image-for-flash/flash-root-minicom.png)

Once flashing is complete, disconnect the USB-Type-C cable from the computer and the board, connect the power cable, and the system will boot up.


#### Potential Issues

If the `lsusb` output shows a download device but the `fastboot` command remains stuck at `< waiting for any device >`, try running the `fastboot` command with `sudo`.
